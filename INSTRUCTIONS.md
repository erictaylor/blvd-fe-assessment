# Intro

Hi ðŸ‘‹ and welcome to the Boulevard frontend engineer take-home assessment!

Weâ€™re so glad you decided to engage in our recruiting process and designed this assessment to be fun, flexible, and let you strut your stuff.

This assessment is purposefully open-ended. We want to see your style â€“ everything from setting up your favorite tools to how you document your code.

We recommend seeing how far you can get in 4 hours.

Soâ€¦ letâ€™s jump in!

## The project

Youâ€™re going to build an _email verification_ web app that mimics the type of stuff we build at Boulevard!

### Here are the requirements:

- Use this repository as a starting point - it is based off of [Create React App](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/tree/master/examples/material-ui-vite-ts)
- Expose a form that lets a user enter an email address
- Consume the [DISIFY email verification API](https://www.disify.com/) to find out whether the email address is valid or disposable and expose that information to the user
- Track the history of validation requests that have been made by the user and show that on the page
- You can use any libraries youâ€™d like to assist in the task, weâ€™re looking to see how you build apps

### Some things we look for:

- Tooling (linting, tests, commit linting, etc.)
- Reasonable styling (nothing too fancy required!)
- Structuring your code in components
- Creating well-defined boundaries between the data-layer and UI-layer
- Using conventional state management techniques
- Small, atomic commits
- Setting up the application be maintainable, extensible, and easy for other developers to contribute to

### Running the app

You will need to use NodeJS version 16.14.2 or greater.
